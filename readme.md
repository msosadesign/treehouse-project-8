# Awesome Startup Employee Directory
## Treehouse Front End Development Techdegree

Technology used:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

This is the eighth project in the Treehouse FEWP techdegree, it focuses on fetching data from an API and showing it asynchronously in a webpage. There's also some js array iteration methods used in the project.

I wrote the HTML and CSS to match the design as closely as possible:

The webpage is responsive as well:

Then I started to work with the employees API, fetching it asynchronously and using promises to catch any errors while loading the info. The code takes 12 random employees and shows them on the webpage, then the user can search by name:

Or click on a specific employee to see all its info from the popup, the user can switch employees and the popup fetches info dynamically:
